# IMI_Big_Data_and_AI_Competition
This project is designed to analyze transactional data and host a web application to interact with the processed results.


## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze transactional data for anomalies, outliers, and trends.
- **Web Application**: Interactive interface to view and manage transaction data.
- **Reproducible Environment**: Virtual environment and Docker container for consistent dependency management.


## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** 3.7 or later
- **`pip`** (Python package installer)
- **Docker** (for running the Docker container)


## Install Packages:
To install Python dependencies, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run App:
To run the web app, use the following commands in the terminal:
python database.py
python user_table.py
python app.py


**Note:**  
- You need to run `database.py` and `user_table.py` only the first time or when you want to clear the databases.
- After the initial setup, you only need to run `app.py` to start the web app.


## Access App:
In your browser, go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/


## Docker Instructions:
This project also supports running within a Docker container for a fully isolated environment.


### ✅ **1. Build the Docker Image**
docker build -t imi_big_data_and_ai_competition .
*This process can take **1 to 2 hours** depending on your system due to package installations and dependencies.*


### ✅ **2. Run the Docker Container**
To run the Docker container with input and output directories mounted:
docker run -it \
    -v $(pwd)/csv_files:/mnt/data:ro \
    -v $(pwd)/output:/mnt/output \
    --network none \
    imi_big_data_and_ai_competition


**Explanation:**
- `-v $(pwd)/csv_files:/mnt/data:ro`: Mounts `csv_files` as a read-only input directory.
- `-v $(pwd)/output:/mnt/output`: Mounts `output` as the directory where output files will be saved.
- `--network none`: Disables network access as required by the competition.


## Output Files:
After running the Docker container, check the `output` folder in your local directory:
ls output
You should see:
- **customer_embeddings.txt**: Embeddings of all customers.
- **Clustering_&_RL_output.ipynb**: The executed Jupyter notebook.
- **Task 1 Outputs:** In `output/task1/`
- **Task 2 Outputs:** In `output/task2/`
## Docker Notes:
- The Docker container is configured to automatically execute the Jupyter notebook `/app/notebooks/Clustering_&_RL.ipynb`.
- Output files and logs are saved to `/mnt/output`.
- Logs can be found in:
output/supervisord.log
output/combined.out.log
output/combined.err.log


**⚠️ Important:**  
- The Docker image can take **1 to 2 hours** to build and run due to dependency installations and data processing.  
- Ensure you have at least **16 GB of disk space** available.

## Troubleshooting
- **Docker Permission Issues:**  
  If you encounter permission issues while running Docker, try using `sudo`:
  sudo docker run -it ...
- **Long Build Time:**  
  Ensure your internet connection is stable during the build process. If possible, allocate more CPU and memory to Docker for faster builds.
- **File Not Found Errors:**  
  Ensure the `csv_files` folder is correctly populated and mounted using `-v $(pwd)/csv_files:/mnt/data:ro`.
